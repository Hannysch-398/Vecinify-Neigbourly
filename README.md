# 🏠 Neighbourly

Welcome to **Neighbourly**! This guide will help you get the development environment up and running, covering the database, backend, and frontend.

---

## 🛠️ Infrastructure (Database & Docker)

We use **Docker** to manage the database and required services.

1.  **Start Docker:** Ensure your Docker Desktop or daemon is active.
2.  **Launch Containers:** Run the following command from the project root:

        docker compose up -d

> Tip:
> The `-d` (detached) flag runs containers in the background, keeping your terminal free for other commands.

##  Git (Github)

Beispiel Branchname:
```bash
NeBo-1-example-name-from-the-ticket
```

## ☕ Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend is built with **Spring Boot** and managed via **Gradle**.

1.  **Navigate to the backend folder:**

        cd backend

2.  **Run the application:**

        # Windows
        .\gradlew bootRun

        # macOS/Linux
        ./gradlew bootRun

---

## 🎨 Frontend (Angular)

The frontend is an **Angular** application located in the `frontend/frontend` subdirectory.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend source:**

        cd frontend/frontend

2.  **Install dependencies:**

        npm install

3.  **Start the development server:**

        ng serve

4.  **Access the App:** Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

* **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have **Node.js**, **Java 17+**, and **Docker** installed.
* **Database Connection:** If the backend throws a connection error on the first try, wait a few seconds for the Docker container to fully initialize and try the `bootRun` command again.

## 🔄 First-Time Setup (Database Reset & Users)

If you just pulled the project or the database setup has changed, follow these steps to ensure everything is initialized correctly.

1. **Stop and remove existing containers and volumes:**

        docker compose down -v

2. **Start fresh containers:**

        docker compose up -d

   > This will initialize the database and automatically run the setup scripts (roles, users, permissions).

3. **Wait a few seconds** for the database to fully start.

4. **Login with your personal database user:**

   Each developer has their own DB user. Use your assigned credentials in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ):

    - **Host:** `localhost`
    - **Port:** `5432`
    - **Database:** `neighbourly`
    - **User:** `<your_name>_dev` (e.g. `yasin_dev`)
    - **Password:** your assigned password

5. **Test the connection**  
   If it fails the first time, wait a few seconds and try again (container startup delay).

## ✅ Database Initialization & Validation (IMPORTANT)

- On the **first pull/start of the database container**, an **init script is automatically executed**.
- When running the backend via `bootRun`, **the same initialization/validation is logged again in the Spring Boot console**.

### You MUST verify the following before starting development:

1. **Does the test table exist?**
    - Table name: `test_table`
    - Check via your DB tool (e.g. IntelliJ Database view)

2. **Did Spring Boot validation succeed?**
    - Look at the CLI where `bootRun` is running
    - There should be a clear log indicating that the validation was successful

### 🚨 If something is wrong:

- **DO NOT start working**
- **DO NOT ignore errors**
- Instead:
    - Report it immediately
    - Let the person responsible for **DB/Docker** fix it

---

## 🧠 Notes

- The database setup (users, roles, permissions) is automatically created via Docker init scripts.
- If something is broken or outdated, always start with:
  ```bash
  docker compose down -v
  ```
- Never use the admin user (`neighbourly_admin`) for normal development.
